## Introduction

This is the companion repository for the paper "Latent Spaces Enable Transformer-Based Dose Prediction in Complex Radiotherapy Plans", presented at MICCAI 2024. Currently, the code available will allow a user to train their own models. 

## Requirements

* Python 3.9
* PyTorch 2.0.1

## Usage

A detailed tutorial is still a work in progress.

## References

The implementation of the transformer is based on Andrej Karpathy's [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT).
The implementation of the VQVAE is based on the [official implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zalandoresearch/pytorch-vq-vae/blob/master/vq-vae.ipynb) by the VQVAE authors.
